# Course_Application
This is a simple course application project built using Spring Boot as the backend technology and MySQL as the database. It is designed for learning purposes and to showcase my skills. Through this project, I have learned how to create REST APIs using Spring Boot, integrate them with a database, and test their functionality using Postman.
